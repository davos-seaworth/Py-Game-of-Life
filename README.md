# Py-Game-of-Life

A Python version of Conway's Game of Life, based on my C version, but with more attention paid to optimization and style.

Dependencies:
Still requires curses for nice output, TODO: have an option for using curses or not


Grid files are formatted slightly differently here than in the C version
